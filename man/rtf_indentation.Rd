\title{Fix Indentation issues in RTF encoded strings}
\usage{
rtf_indentation(string)
}
\arguments{
\item{string}{A character vector specifying the RTF encodings.}
}
\value{
A character string containing the processed RTF content with
indentation codes replaced by HTML non-breaking space entities (\verb{&nbsp;}).
}
\description{
Processes an RTF (Rich Text Format) encoded string to fix indentation issues
by replacing RTF-specific indentation codes and spaces with HTML non-breaking
space entities.
}
\details{
The function performs the following transformations:
\itemize{
\item Replaces spaces immediately after opening braces before \verb{\\cell\}} with
the same number of \verb{&nbsp;} calls.
\item Converts \verb{\\li192} codes to two non-breaking spaces
\item Converts \verb{\\li384} codes to four non-breaking spaces
\item Converts \verb{\\li576} codes to six non-breaking spaces
}

These transformations correspond to different levels of indentation commonly
found in RTF table cells and list items.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
rtf_indentation("{  two spaces inside the cell\\\\cell}")
rtf_indentation("\\\\li192{two spaces before the cell\\\\cell}")
rtf_indentation("\\\\li576{ Seven spaces in total\\\\cell}")
}
