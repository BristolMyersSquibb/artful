\title{Fix Indentation in RTF Files}
\usage{
fix_indentation(file)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{A character string specifying the path to the RTF file to be
processed. The file should be readable and contain valid RTF content.}
}
\value{
A character string containing the processed RTF content with
indentation codes replaced by HTML non-breaking space entities (\verb{&nbsp;}).
The original file is not modified; only the processed string is returned.
}
\description{
Processes an RTF (Rich Text Format) file to fix indentation issues by
replacing RTF-specific indentation codes and spaces with HTML non-breaking
space entities.
}
\details{
The function performs the following transformations:
\itemize{
\item Replaces spaces immediately after opening braces before \verb{\\cell\}} with \verb{&nbsp;}
\item Converts \verb{\\li192} codes to two non-breaking spaces
\item Converts \verb{\\li384} codes to four non-breaking spaces
\item Converts \verb{\\li576} codes to six non-breaking spaces
}

These transformations correspond to different levels of indentation commonly
found in RTF table cells and list items.
