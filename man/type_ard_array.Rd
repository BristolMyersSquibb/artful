\title{Create ARD Array Type Specification for Structured Data Extraction}
\usage{
type_ard_array()
}
\value{
A \code{type_array} object containing \code{type_object}
specifications that can be used with \code{chat_structured()} to ensure
ARD-compliant JSON output from LLMs.
}
\description{
Creates a type specification for extracting Analysis Results Data (ARD)
formatted data from clinical trial tables using ellmer's structured data
functionality. This ensures LLM responses conform to the ARD standard
with properly typed and validated fields.
}
\details{
The ARD (Analysis Results Data) standard requires each statistical result
to be represented as a separate record with context about grouping variables,
the variable being analyzed, and standardized statistic names and labels.

The type specification includes:
\itemize{
\item Optional table identifier
\item Up to 3 levels of grouping variables (group1, group2, group3)
\item Primary variable and optional variable level for categorical data
\item Standardized statistic names and labels from the ARD mapping table
\item The statistical value as a string
}
