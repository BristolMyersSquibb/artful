# artful
a**rtf**ul is an experimental R package to convert RTF tables into R data frames following the [Analysis Results Data (ARD) standard](https://wiki.cdisc.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=222298985).

## Installation

```r
# Install development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("BristolMyersSquibb/artful")
```

## Getting Started

### Quick Example

```r
library(artful)
library(dplyr)

# Convert an RTF table to ARD format
# Note: RTF files containing clinical trial data are not included in the repository
# due to proprietary data restrictions. You'll need to provide your own RTF files.

# Example usage with an RTF file
ard_df <- rtf_to_ard(system.file(package = 'artful', 'extdata/examples', 'rt-ae-ae1.rtf'))

# Example output structure:
# # A tibble: 120 Ã— 7
#    group1 group1_level        variable variable_level stat_name stat_label stat
#    <chr>  <chr>               <chr>    <chr>          <chr>     <chr>      <chr>
#  1 TRT    Placebo             Age      Mean           mean      Mean       65.2
#  2 TRT    Placebo             Age      SD             sd        SD         8.4
#  3 TRT    Treatment Arm A     Age      Mean           mean      Mean       63.8
#  4 TRT    Treatment Arm A     Age      SD             sd        SD         9.1
# ...
```

### Data Requirements

The RTF source files in `inst/extdata/` are gitignored as they contain proprietary clinical trial data. To use this package, you need to:

1. Obtain RTF table files from your clinical trial data management system
2. Ensure RTF files contain properly formatted tables (not just text)
3. Place them in a local directory accessible to R

The package is designed to handle RTF tables typically exported from SAS or other statistical software used in clinical trials.

### Creating ARD from Scratch

You can also create ARD-formatted data using the [cards](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/) package:

```r
library(cards)

# Example with synthetic clinical trial data
# Create ARD from raw data
ard_stack(
  data = ADSL,
  ard_categorical(variables = "AGEGR1"),
  ard_continuous(variables = "AGE"),
  .by = "ARM",
  .overall = TRUE,
  .attributes = TRUE
)

# The resulting format is compatible with artful's output
# Both can be used interchangeably in downstream analyses
```

## Heuristics
artful works by first converting RTF tables into HTML tables via [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
Then, [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) is used to extract the HTML table into an R data frame.
Next, a set of heuristics is used to convert the R data frame to follow the ARD standard. Below is a record of these heuristics, which informs the parsing rules followed in `R/parse.R`:

1. Titles, subtitles, and footnotes should be stripped (and optionally stored as additional attributes or separate metadata). This includes repeated occurances caused by pagination.
2. Repeated column names, caused by pagination, should be stripped.
3. Indented columns should be separated out into unique columns.
4. Merged columns (e.g., where a count and percentage are combined into a single string) should be separated out into unique columns.
5. Empty rows (where all cells are empty strings) should be removed.
6. Spanning columns headers should be separated out into grouping columns (i.e., a spanning column header represents a unique grouping identifier for the columns it spans over).

## Coverage
As the RTF tables this package attempts to convert are designed to be human readable, and not machine readable, this package will never be able to guarantee 100% coverage across all tables.
Instead the heuristics described above should continually be updated inline with any changes to the code made to accomodate new RTF tables which did not fit the previous rule set.

## ARD standard
ARD is a standardised, machine-readable format specifically designed for encoding statistical analysis summaries derived from clinical trial data.
However, the ARD standard is still not concretely defined.
This means it is open to interpretation and has some scope of flexibility in terms of columns to be included.
Approximately defined, an ARD data frame should abide to the following criteria:

1. Each row represents a single statistical value (e.g., a count and a percentage must be separated into unique rows and not share the same cell such as "10 (15%)" as is commonly observed in the RTF tables).
This means ARD data frames are somewhat adjacent to tidy data frames in a long format.

2. Each row can provide the context to uniquely identify the unique statistical result value.
This means the data frame should include at least the follow columns (with recommended column names in brackets):
- group names (`group<N>`)
- group levels (`group<N>_level`)
- variable names (`variable`)
- variable levels (`variable_level`)
- statistical names (`stat_name`)
- statistical label (`stat_label`)
- statistical value (`stat`)

3. To create standardisation with other packages such as [cards](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/), the following `stat_name` and `stat_label` values should be used:

| `stat_name` | `stat_label`         | Description                                                          |
