## TASK

Your task is to convert {{user_json}} to the CDISC Analysisâ€‘Ready Data (ARD) standard.

## ARD STANDARD

An ARD data frame should abide to the following criteria:

1. Each row represents a single statistical value.

2. Each row provides the context to uniquely identify a single statistical result value.
   For example, a statistic in a single row would be linked to the specific study, subject group, parameter, and statistical test that generated it.

## RULES

1. **Split Compound Statistics:**
   If a single stat cell contains multiple values (e.g., "12 (15.4%)" for count and percentage), you MUST generate separate JSON members for each stat.
   For example, one for the count (n) with value 12, and one for the percentage (p) with value 15.4.
   The values of the other cells in the original row will just repeat across the members.

2. **Standardize Statistic Names:** 
   You MUST populate the `stat_name` and `stat_label` fields using the standardized names from this mapping table:

| `stat_name` | `stat_label`        | Description                                                       |
| :---------- | :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `n`         | "n" or "Count"      | Count of subjects or records in a specific category or group.     |
| `N`         | "N" or "Total N"    | Total number of subjects in a group, often used as a denominator. |
| `N_obs`     | "N Observed"        | Number of non-missing observations.                               |
| `N_miss`    | "N Missing"         | Number of missing observations.                                   |
| `p`         | "%" or "Percent"    | Proportion (value between 0 and 1).                               |
| `pct`       | "%" or "Percent"    | Percentage (proportion \* 100).                                   |
| `mean`      | "Mean"              | Arithmetic mean.                                                  |
| `sd`        | "SD" or "Std Dev"   | Standard Deviation.                                               |
| `se`        | "SE" or "Std Err"   | Standard Error of the Mean.                                       |
| `median`    | "Median"            | Median (50th percentile).                                         |
| `geom_mean` | "Geometric Mean"    | Geometric mean, often used for log-transformed data.              |
| `cv`        | "CV (%)"            | Coefficient of Variation.                                         |
| `min`       | "Min" or "Minimum"  | Minimum value.                                                    |
| `max`       | "Max" or "Maximum"  | Maximum value.                                                    |
| `range`     | "Range"             | The range of values (`max` - `min`).                              |
| `p25`       | "Q1" or "25th Pctl" | 25th Percentile (First Quartile).                                 |
| `p75`       | "Q3" or "75th Pctl" | 75th Percentile (Third Quartile).                                 |
| `iqr`       | "IQR"               | Interquartile Range (`p75` - `p25`).                              |
| `estimate`  | "Estimate"          | Model parameter estimate (e.g., difference in means).             |
| `conf.low`  | "Lower CL"          | Lower bound of the confidence interval.                           |
| `conf.high` | "Upper CL"          | Upper bound of the confidence interval.                           |
| `p.value`   | "p-value"           | The p-value from a statistical test.                              |
| `statistic` | "Statistic"         | The value of the test statistic (e.g., t-value, F-value).         |
| `df`        | "df"                | Degrees of Freedom.                                               |
| `null`      | "Unknown"           | An unknown statistics                                             |

3. **Data Integrity:**
   Do not calculate, infer, or hallucinate any values.
   If a value is missing, represent it as `null`.
   If you are not sure about a value, represnt it as `null`.
