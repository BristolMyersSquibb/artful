## TASK

Here are two inputs representing the same clinical analysis data:

1. PDF: <user-pdf>file id: {{user_file_id}}</user-pdf>
2. HTML: <user-html>{{user_html}}</user-html>.

Your task is to convert the <user-pdf> and <user-html> inputs to the CDISC Analysisâ€‘Ready Data (ARD) standard.

## ARD STANDARD

An ARD data frame should abide to the following criteria:

1. Each row represents a single statistical value (e.g., a count and a percentage must be separated into unique rows and not share the same cell such as "10 (15%)" as is commonly observed in the RTF tables).
   This means ARD data frames are somewhat adjacent to tidy data frames in a long format.

2. Each row provides the context to uniquely identify a single statistical result value.
   For example, a statistic in a single row would be linked to the specific study, subject group, parameter, and statistical test that generated it.

## METHODOLOGY

- Use <user-pdf> as the definitive source for the table's visual layout, hierarchy, and relationships between rows and columns.
- Use <user-html> code to ensure the accuracy of every character and number you extract.
- Cross-reference both sources to achieve the most accurate parsing possible.

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Process All Data:**
   Ensure that results from all pages are included in the final JSON output.
   Ensure that all values found in <user-html> appear at least once in your final output.

2. **Split Compound Statistics:**
   If a single stat cell contains multiple values (e.g., "12 (15.4%)" for count and percentage), you MUST generate separate JSON members for each stat.
   For example, one for the count (n) with value 12, and one for the percentage (p) with value 15.4.
   The values of the other cells in the original row will just repeat across the members.

3. **Standardize Statistic Names:** 
   You MUST populate the `stat_name` and `stat_label` fields using the standardized names from this mapping table:

| `stat_name` | `stat_label`        | Description                                                       |
